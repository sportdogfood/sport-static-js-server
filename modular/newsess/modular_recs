Recommendations:
Maintain Consistent Naming Conventions: Ensure that all functions and variables follow a consistent naming pattern to enhance code readability and maintainability.

Implement Event Listeners Across the Application: Utilize the custom events dispatched by session modules (userAuthenticated, userStateChanged, userLoggedOut) to trigger corresponding UI updates or other actions throughout your application.

Error Handling: Continue to implement comprehensive error handling across all modules to manage failures gracefully without disrupting the user experience.

Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation of each module and its functionalities to aid future development and onboarding of new team members.

Testing: Rigorously test each module individually and in integration to ensure that all interactions function as expected across various scenarios.

Optimize Module Imports: As your application scales, consider further optimizing module imports and exports to prevent unnecessary code duplication and enhance performance.

Security Best Practices: Ensure that all sensitive data is handled securely, leveraging best practices such as using secure cookies, validating user inputs, and safeguarding against common web vulnerabilities.
